# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for creating a study guide webpage was so that I could lookback on notes through various sections to help me study better in the future.  I built this website to have a place of storage for my knowledge, while also learning how to create something.  By learning how to build a beginner webpage, I have familiarized myself enough to be excited about the new world of opportunities that coding presents.  I learned to trust my problem solving skills, and have patience with myself during something so new.

To properly use the Prework Study Guide Webpage, there are notes under each section that help outline important ideas.  The webpage is broken up into four catagories, HTML, CSS, Git, and Java Script.  Each subject will have 3-4 bulleted items that are imporant factors of each subject.
